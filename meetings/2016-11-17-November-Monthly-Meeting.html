  <p>This month we’re going to try something new. We’re featuring katas from <a href="http://exercism.io/">exercisim.io</a>. There are 5 to choose from:</p>
<h2 id="difficulty-easy">Difficulty: Easy</h2>
<h3 id="bob"><a href="http://exercism.io/exercises/haskell/bob/readme">Bob</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.</p>
<p>Bob answers ‘Sure.’ if you ask him a question.</p>
<p>He answers ‘Whoa, chill out!’ if you yell at him.</p>
<p>He says ‘Fine. Be that way!’ if you address him without actually saying anything.</p>
<p>He answers ‘Whatever.’ to anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Write a program that will give the correct response for an input phrase.</p>
<p>If the phrase is a normal question, Bob responds ‘Sure’.</p>
<p>If the phrase is in all capital letters, Bob responds ‘Whoa, chill out!’.</p>
<p>If the phrase is empty, Bob responds ‘Fine. Be that way!’.</p>
<p>For everything else, Bob responds ‘Whatever’.</p>
<h3 id="leap"><a href="http://exercism.io/exercises/haskell/leap/readme">Leap</a></h3>
<p>Write a program that can take a year and tell you if it is a leap year.</p>
<p>A leap year, in the Gregorian calendar, occurs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On every year that is evenly divisible by 4</p>
<p>Except every year that is evenly divisible by 100</p>
<p>Unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="difficulty-medium">Difficulty: Medium</h2>
<h3 id="hamming"><a href="http://exercism.io/exercises/haskell/hamming/readme">Hamming</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a program that can calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.</p>
<p>A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect throughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact, the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.</p>
<p>The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point mutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.</p>
<p>By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of &gt; the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the evolutionary path between the two strands.</p>
<p>This is called the ‘Hamming distance’.</p>
<p>It is found by comparing two DNA strands and counting how many of the nucleotides are different from their equivalent in the other string.</p>

<p>Note: The Hamming distance is only defined on sequences of equal length.</p>
<h3 id="robot-simulator"><a href="http://exercism.io/exercises/haskell/robot-simulator/readme">Robot Simulator</a></h3>
<p>Write a robot simulator.</p>
<p>A robot factory’s test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.</p>
<p>The robots have three possible movements:</p>
<ul>
<li>turn right</li>
<li>turn left</li>
<li>advance</li>
</ul>
<p>Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates, e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.</p>
<p>The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot’s new position, and in which direction it is pointing.</p>
<p>The letter-string “RAALAL” means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn right</li>
<li>Advance twice</li>
<li>Turn left</li>
<li>Advance once</li>
</ul>
<p>Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.</p>
<h2 id="difficulty-hard">Difficulty: Hard</h2>
<h3 id="minesweeper">Minesweeper</h3>
<p>Write a program that adds the numbers to a minesweeper board</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.</p>
<p>In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of mines adjacent to a square and transforms boards like this (where <code>*</code> indicates a mine):</p>
